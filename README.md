# Overview

This was a project I decided to take on to work a little bit with classes in kotlin.

This program resembles a combat system similar one to on RuneScape. It's not nearly as complex but it was a fun little project. As RuneScape was something I 
loved to play as a kid.

My purpose for the software was really just to help improve my ability in kotlin.

Kotlin was the language that I used to develop this program.

# Future Work

* I would like to add a tracker to keep track of who keeps the most damage.
* Incorporating hitpoints was something also I did but actually once a player runs out of hitpoints they would die.
* The final thing I think would be fun for this would to be incorporate armor and so on and so forth.
